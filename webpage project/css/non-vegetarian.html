          <p class="lead">Bring 3 litres / 3 quarts water to the boil, add salt and spices.Add rice, bring back up to the boil then cook for 4 minutes, or until rice is just cooked still a bit firm in the middle. Rice will taste salty at this stage, disappears in next stage of cooking.</p><br>
          <p class="lead">Drain immediately. Set aside. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium high heat. Cook onion, in batches, for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden brown. Don't burn - they become bitter.Remove onto paper towel lined plate. Repeat with remaining onion.</p>
          <p class="lead">Place pot with chicken in it onto a stove over medium heat. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.Remove lid. Cook for 5 minutes, turning chicken twice.Remove from heat. Turn chicken so skin side is down - it should cover most of the base of the pot.</p>
          <p class="lead">Scatter over half the onion then half the coriander.Top with all the rice. Gently pat down and flatten surface.Drizzle saffron across rice surface in random pattern, then drizzle over ghee. Place lid on. Return to stove over medium heat.</p><br>
          <p class="lead">As soon as you see steam, turn down to low then cook for 25 minutes.Remove from stove, rest with lid on for 10 minutes. Use a large spoon and dig deep into the pot, and try to scoop up as much as you can in one scoop.</p><br>
          <p class="lead">Turn out into bowl - or onto platter. Garnish with remaining onion and coriander </p>

            <h1>Grilled Chicken</h1>
            <p class="lead">In a medium bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon, brown sugar, Worcestershire, garlic, thyme, oregano and rosemary; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Reserve 1/4 cup and set aside.</p><br>
            <p class="lead">In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine balsamic vinegar mixture and chicken; marinate for at least 1 hour to overnight, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade.</p><br>
            <p class="lead">Preheat grill to medium high heat. Add chicken to grill and cook, flipping once and basting with reserved 1/4 cup marinade until cooked through, about 5-6 minutes on each side. Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.</p><br>
            <p class="lead">Enjoy!</p>

            <h1>Grilled Shrimp</h1>
            <p class="lead">Place the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic in a resealable plastic bag. Seal and shake to combine. Add the shrimp to the bag and seal. Toss to coat evenly with the marinade.</p><br>
            <p class="lead">Marinate for at least 15 minutes or up to 2 hours. You don't want to marinate for longer than that, as the acid in the lemon juice will start to cook the shrimp. Thread the shrimp onto skewers.  Heat a grill or grill pan over medium high heat.</p><br>
            <p class="lead">Place the skewers on the grill. Cook for 2-3 minutes on each side or until shrimp are pink and opaque.</p>
            <p class="lead">Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges. Enjoy!</p>
